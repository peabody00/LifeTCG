# LifeTCG

Welcome to LifeTCG, a simple game that allows you to collect cards.  This simple web app is my Module 2 project for Flatiron School.  

## Installation

To run this application first clone the code from GitHub.

After cloning the repository run `bundle install` to install any required gems.

Run `shotgun` from the prompt to start the local webserver.

In any browser, navigate to http://localhost:9393/ to start using the app.

## Usage

LifeTCG is a simple Sinatra project to explore RESTful routes and CRUD operations.  The user can sign up for an account and explore the website.  Users can post messages on the wall for all users to see.  They can edit and delete their own posts.  In the collection area the user can collect LifeTCG cards and see how their Life score grows with their collection.  

**As of this commit the planned trading function has not been implemented.  That feature turned out to be much more complicated than anticipated.  I am turning in the current state of my project that meets the project requirements.  I have done a lot work on the trading feature but it is not ready yet.  Some of the work can be seen in the code.  There is a trade controller with some views as well as a trade table and a trade model.**
